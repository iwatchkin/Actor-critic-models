# DDPG
## Project Description

This project implements a Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm for solving the pendulumn task from the OpenAI Gym. The DDPG algorithm is a model-free, off-policy algorithm for continuous action spaces, which combines the strengths of both Q-learning and policy gradient methods. The implementation utilizes the OpenAI Gym environment to train an agent to control a pendulumn using reinforcement learning.

## Features
- Implementation of DDPG algorithm
- Training an agent to solve the pendulumn task
- Utilization of OpenAI Gym environment for reinforcement learning
